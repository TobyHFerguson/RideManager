# RideManager
This library contains [GAS](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) code that provides the basic library functions for manipulating the [Consolidated Rides Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kEPFyWarRLxS5oEww5dDosAh-k5CtGE-b-dE7EOOicU/edit?usp=sharing) 
as a [bound script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/bound).

The library functions are exposed via items in the 'Ride Schedulers' menu.
