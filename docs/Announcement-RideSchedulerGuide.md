# Ride Announcement System - Ride Scheduler's Guide

**For:** Ride Schedulers who create and manage ride announcements  
**Focus:** Creating announcements, editing content, ensuring messages are sent

---

## Quick Start

### Scheduling a Ride

1. **In the spreadsheet**, select the row(s) for your ride(s)
2. **Click:** Ride Schedulers → Schedule Selected Rides
   If the ride is successfully scheduled a new announcement document will be made from the template (your own personal template or, if that can't be found, the [master template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tFcT5H1Sul0r0Nez2xdaqMP2MkvzB8HvkLLRwUr3Lns/edit?usp=drive_link))
3. **Click the link** in the `Announcement` column to open your document
4. **Edit the document** - add details, photos, emojis, formatting
5. **(Optional) Test it** - send a test announcement to yourself to check what it'll look like
6. **That's it!** The email will be sent automatically 2 days before the ride at 6:00 PM


### Updating a Ride

When a ride is updated the announcement system will:
- Update the Announcement document title to match the new ride title
- Update the SendAt date to 2 days before the ride at 6:00 PM

If a ride doesn't have an Announcement (or the doc can't be read) then a new Announcement will be created and scheduled.


### Canceling/Reinstating a Ride

When a ride is cancelled/reinstated if an announcement has been sent then you'll be asked if you want to send an announcement and will be given the opportunity to supply a short reason. The announcement will be sent immediately. 

The [Cancelation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XMPrkE5G2yXuu5zf1ZwuIFApYpPqxH8I8IUKfiW5ZQw/edit?tab=t.0) & [Reinstatement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18s6kr4B3Ofu8rZUYCGeKNZWyEvnMRHOWuPXC_Tskl5s/edit?tab=t.0) Templates are short - you don't get the chance to edit it!

---

## Using Your Own Template (Optional)

### What is a Personal Template?

By default, all announcements use the club's [master template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tFcT5H1Sul0r0Nez2xdaqMP2MkvzB8HvkLLRwUr3Lns/edit?usp=drive_link). But you can create your own template with your personal style, favorite emojis, or custom layout!

### How to Set Up Your Personal Template

1. **Create your template document:**
   - Create a template in the [Ride Announcements](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uwZzbl1SkkAOwA_6-uIj-ZR368_sxJNm?usp=sharing) folder by:
     - Creating it from scratch
     - Copying another Template
     - Copying an announcement that is ready to be sent
   - Make sure you:
     *  Share it with `toby.h.ferguson@gmail.com` as `Viewer`
     *  Name it so its clear to you and others just what it is!
   - Customize it with your preferred formatting, emojis, layout
   - Keep the `{FieldName}` placeholders where you want ride data

2. **Add yourself to Personal Templates sheet:**
   - Open the "Personal Templates" sheet in the CRS
   - Add a new row with:
     - **Email**: Your full email address (e.g., `yourname@gmail.com`)
     - **TemplateURL**: Link to your template document
     - **Active**: `TRUE`
     - **Notes**: (Optional) Description like "Uses lots of emojis"

3. **Test it:**
   - Create a test announcement
   - Verify it uses your template
   - If not working, check email matches exactly and Active = TRUE

### When Your Template is Used

- ✅ When YOU create an announcement → Uses YOUR template
- ✅ When other schedulers create → Uses THEIR template (or master if they have none)
- ✅ You can switch back to master by setting Active = FALSE

### Managing Your Template

**To update your template:**
- Just edit your template document
- Future announcements will use the updated version
- Already-created announcements are not affected

**To stop using your template:**
- Change `Active` to `FALSE` in Personal Templates sheet
- You'll use the master template instead

**To switch templates:**
- Update the `TemplateURL` in your row
- New announcements will use the new template

## How Announcements Work

### Timeline

```
Today: Create announcement
    ↓
Document created from template; `sendAt` column date is 2 days before ride start, at 6:00 pm
    ↓
Edit document (add custom content, photos, details)
    ↓
`sendAt` date & time (default - 6:00 PM, 2 days before ride): Email sent automatically
    ↓
Done!
```

### When Emails Are Sent

**Rule:** Announcements send at **6:00 PM, 2 calendar days before your ride**

**Examples:**
- Your ride: Saturday 12/7 at 9:00 AM → Email sends: Thursday 12/5 at 6:00 PM
- Your ride: Monday 12/9 at 5:00 PM → Email sends: Saturday 12/7 at 6:00 PM
- Your ride: Sunday 12/8 at 8:00 AM → Email sends: Friday 12/6 at 6:00 PM

### Template Fields (Already Filled In)

When the announcement document is created these template fields are available to be used - they'll automatically get filled in with the latest information from the ride and route just prior to sending:

- `{DateTime}` - Full date and time (e.g., "Saturday, December 7, 2024 at 10:00 AM")

You can edit or remove any of this auto-filled information if needed.

### Editing Tips

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Keep images under 100KB for best email delivery
- ✅ Use emojis for visual appeal (they work perfectly!)
- ✅ Test links to make sure they work
- ✅ Preview how it looks before the send time
- ✅ Edit anytime before the scheduled send

**Things to Avoid:**
- ❌ Don't delete the entire document
- ❌ Don't remove the document from the announcements folder
- ❌ Very large images (>100KB) may not display in some email clients

### Editing After Creation

**You can edit anytime until the email sends!**

1. Open the document (click `Announcement` column link)
2. Make your changes
3. The changes are automatically saved by Google Docs
4. When the scheduled time arrives, the email will include your latest edits

### Sending a Test Announcement
Simply select the row or rows you want test announcements for (any column) then select the `Ride Schedulers --> Test Selected Announcements` - you'll be prompted for an email address, and then the announcement(s) will be sent to that address. (Only `pending` announcements can be tested - others will be ignored!)

### Sending immediately
If you just decide you want to send one or more announcements **officially** right now then select the announcements (only `pending` - others will be ignored!) and select `Ride Schedulers --> Send Pending Announcements`.

## Checking Status

### Status Column Values

Look at the `Status` column in your ride row:

| Status | What It Means | What You Should Do |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| `pending` | Waiting to send at scheduled time | Nothing - it will send automatically |
| `sent` | Email was successfully sent | Nothing - you're done! |
| `failed` | Send failed | Check with operator if it doesn't resolve |
| *(empty)* | No announcement created yet | Create announcement if you want one |

### Other Helpful Columns

| Column | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| `Announcement` | Link to your Google Doc |
| `SendAt` | When the email will send (or was scheduled to send) |
| `Attempts` | How many times system tried to send |
| `LastError` | Error message if something went wrong |

---

## Common Scenarios

### "I want to preview the email before it sends"

1. Open your announcement document (click `Announcement` link)
2. That's exactly what people will receive!
3. The document content is converted to email format when sent
4. Make any edits you want - they'll be included

### "I need to make a last-minute change"

No problem!
1. Open the announcement document
2. Make your edits
3. As long as the current time is before the `SendAt` time, your changes will be included

**Even 5 minutes before send time is fine!**

### "I want to add photos from the ride route"

1. Open the announcement document
2. Click where you want the photo
3. Insert → Image → Upload from computer (or paste from clipboard)
4. Resize the image (smaller is better - under 100KB recommended)
5. Save (automatic in Google Docs)

### "I made a mistake - can I cancel the announcement?"

**Before it sends:**
- Ask an operator to change the `Status` to `cancelled`
- Or delete the content in the `Announcement` column

**After it sends:**
- You cannot recall the email (like regular email)
- You could send a follow-up correction if needed

### "The announcement hasn't sent yet and it's past the scheduled time"

1. Ensure the announcement status is `pending`
2. Select the ride and then run `Send Pending Announcements`

### "Can I use my own announcement template style?"

Yes! You can create a personal template:

1. **Create your template document**
   - Copy the master template or create from scratch
   - Customize with your style, emojis, layout
   - Keep `{FieldName}` placeholders for ride data

2. **Register it in Personal Templates sheet**
   - Add row: Your Email | Template URL | Active=TRUE | Notes
   - System will use your template for your announcements

3. **Others keep using their templates**
   - Each scheduler can have their own template
   - Or use the master template if they prefer

See "Using Your Own Template" section above for details.

### "I want to include a special message about weather/cancellation"

Perfect use case for editing!
1. Open your announcement document
2. Add a prominent note at the top:
   ```
   ⚠️ WEATHER UPDATE: Check email morning of ride for any cancellations
   ```
3. Use colors, bold, or larger fonts to make it stand out

## Cancelling or Reinstating Rides with Announcements

### What Happens When You Cancel a Ride

When you cancel a ride that has an announcement:

**If you cancel BEFORE the announcement send time (6 PM, 2 days before):**
- The announcement status changes to "cancelled"
- The announcement email will NOT be sent
- No cancellation notice is sent
- The system just quietly stops the announcement

**If you cancel AFTER the announcement send time:**
- The announcement status changes to "cancelled"
- A cancellation email is IMMEDIATELY sent to all riders
- The email uses the cancellation template
- You'll be asked to provide a brief reason for the cancellation

### What Happens When You Reinstate a Cancelled Ride

When you reinstate a previously cancelled ride:

**If you reinstate BEFORE the announcement send time:**
- The announcement status returns to "pending"
- The announcement will be sent at the normal time (6 PM, 2 days before)
- No reinstatement notice is sent immediately
- Everything returns to normal

**If you reinstate AFTER the announcement send time:**
- The announcement status returns to "pending"
- A reinstatement email is IMMEDIATELY sent to all riders
- The email uses the reinstatement template
- You'll be asked to provide a brief reason for the reinstatement
- Note: The regular announcement already went out, this just notifies people the ride is back on

### Examples

**Example 1: Early Cancellation (Quiet)**
- Ride scheduled: Saturday, December 7 at 10:00 AM
- Announcement send time: Thursday, December 5 at 6:00 PM
- You cancel: Wednesday, December 4 at 3:00 PM
- Result: Announcement cancelled quietly, no email sent to anyone

**Example 2: Late Cancellation (Email Sent)**
- Ride scheduled: Saturday, December 7 at 10:00 AM
- Announcement send time: Thursday, December 5 at 6:00 PM
- Announcement was sent: Thursday, December 5 at 6:05 PM
- You cancel: Friday, December 6 at 10:00 AM
- Result: Cancellation email sent immediately to all riders

**Example 3: Early Reinstatement (Quiet)**
- Ride cancelled: Wednesday, December 4
- You reinstate: Thursday, December 5 at 3:00 PM
- Announcement send time: Thursday, December 5 at 6:00 PM
- Result: Announcement sent at 6 PM as originally planned

**Example 4: Late Reinstatement (Email Sent)**
- Announcement already sent: Thursday, December 5 at 6:05 PM
- Ride cancelled: Friday, December 6 at 8:00 AM
- Cancellation email sent: Friday, December 6 at 8:05 AM
- You reinstate: Friday, December 6 at 2:00 PM
- Result: Reinstatement email sent immediately to all riders

### Tips

- **Cancel early if possible** - If you know you need to cancel, do it before the announcement goes out to avoid confusion
- **Provide a clear reason** - When you cancel/reinstate after the announcement time, you'll be asked for a reason. Be brief but clear: "Heavy rain forecast" or "Weather improved"
- **Check the announcement status** - After cancelling/reinstating, check the spreadsheet to verify the status changed correctly
- **Rides without announcements** - If you didn't create an announcement for a ride, cancelling/reinstating works normally but no emails are sent
