### Template Fields (Already Filled In)

- `{DateTime}` - Full date and time (e.g., "Saturday, December 7, 2024 at 10:00 AM")
- `{Date}` - Date only (e.g., "December 7, 2024")
- `{Day}` - Day of week (e.g., "Saturday")
- `{Time}` - Time only (e.g., "10:00 AM")

- `{RideLeader}` - Name(s) of the ride leader(s)
- `{Group}` - Ride group (e.g., A, B, C etc.)

- `{Lat}` - Ride start latitude (e.g., "37.7749")
- `{Long}` - Ride start longitude (e.g., "-122.4194")
- `{StartPin}` - Map links to ride start: (e.g., [Apple Maps](https://maps.apple.com/?ll=36.97803,-121.90091&q=Ride%20Start) / [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=36.97803,-121.90091))

You can edit or remove any of this auto-filled information if needed.

### Editing Tips

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Keep images under 100KB for best email delivery
- ✅ Use emojis for visual appeal (they work perfectly!)
- ✅ Test links to make sure they work
- ✅ Preview how it looks before the send time
- ✅ Edit anytime before the scheduled send

**Things to Avoid:**
- ❌ Don't delete the entire document
- ❌ Don't remove the document from the announcements folder
- ❌ Very large images (>100KB) may not display in some email clients

### Editing After Creation

**You can edit anytime until the email sends!**

1. Open the document (click `Announcement` column link)
2. Make your changes
3. The changes are automatically saved by Google Docs
4. When the scheduled time arrives, the email will include your latest edits

### Sending a Test Announcement
Simply select the row or rows you want test announcements for (any column) then select the `Ride Schedulers / Test Selected Announcements` - you'll be prompted for an email address, and then the announcement(s) will be sent to that address. (Only `pending` announcements can be tested - others will be ignored!)

### Sending immediately
If you just decide you want to send one or more announcements **officially** right now then select the announcements (only `pending` - others will be ignored!) and select `Ride Schedulers / Send Pending Announcements`.

## Checking Status

### Status Column Values

Look at the `Status` column in your ride row:

| Status | What It Means | What You Should Do |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| `pending` | Waiting to send at scheduled time | Nothing - it will send automatically |
| `sent` | Email was successfully sent | Nothing - you're done! |
| `failed` | Send failed (system is retrying) | Check with operator if it doesn't resolve |
| *(empty)* | No announcement created yet | Create announcement if you want one |

### Other Helpful Columns

| Column | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| `Announcement` | Link to your Google Doc |
| `SendAt` | When the email will send (or was scheduled to send) |
| `Attempts` | How many times system tried to send |
| `LastError` | Error message if something went wrong |

---

## Common Scenarios

### "I want to preview the email before it sends"

1. Open your announcement document (click `Announcement` link)
2. That's exactly what people will receive!
3. The document content is converted to email format when sent
4. Make any edits you want - they'll be included

### "I need to make a last-minute change"

No problem!
1. Open the announcement document
2. Make your edits
3. As long as the current time is before the `SendAt` time, your changes will be included

**Even 5 minutes before send time is fine!**

### "I want to add photos from the ride route"

1. Open the announcement document
2. Click where you want the photo
3. Insert → Image → Upload from computer (or paste from clipboard)
4. Resize the image (smaller is better - under 100KB recommended)
5. Save (automatic in Google Docs)

### "I made a mistake - can I cancel the announcement?"

**Before it sends:**
- Ask an operator to change the `Status` to `cancelled`
- Or delete the content in the `Announcement` column

**After it sends:**
- You cannot recall the email (like regular email)
- You could send a follow-up correction if needed

### "The announcement hasn't sent yet and it's past the scheduled time"

**Don't panic!** The system has automatic retry logic:

1. **Check `Status` column:**
   - If `pending` → May send within 15 minutes (system checks every 15 min)
   - If `failed` → System is automatically retrying (see retry schedule below)
   - If `sent` → It was sent! Check spam folder

2. **If status is `failed`:**
   - System retries automatically with these intervals:
     - 1st retry: 5 minutes later
     - 2nd retry: 15 minutes later
     - 3rd retry: 30 minutes later
     - Then: 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, 8hr intervals
   - Retries continue for 24 hours
   - If still failing, contact an operator

3. **If you need it sent urgently:**
   - Contact an operator - they can manually trigger a send

### "Can I reuse an announcement for a recurring ride?"

Each ride needs its own announcement, but you can:
1. Create the first announcement
2. Copy content from that document
3. Paste into future announcements for the same ride
4. Update specific details (date, leaders, etc.)

### "I want to include a special message about weather/cancellation"

Perfect use case for editing!
1. Open your announcement document
2. Add a prominent note at the top:
   ```
   ⚠️ WEATHER UPDATE: Check email morning of ride for any cancellations
   ```
3. Use colors, bold, or larger fonts to make it stand out
