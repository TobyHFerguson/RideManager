## Architecture Overview
This is a Google Apps Script (GAS) project that manages ride scheduling through integration with RideWithGPS and Google Calendar. The codebase mixes GAS-specific APIs with standard JavaScript/Node.js code.

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### GAS vs Pure JavaScript Separation
The codebase is transitioning toward better separation between GAS-specific code and pure JavaScript:

- **Pure JavaScript modules** (can run in Node.js/Jest):
  - `Event.js` - Event data model
  - `EventFactory.js` - Event creation logic
  - `Groups.js` - Group specifications
  - `Globals.js` - Global configuration
  - `Commands.js` - Business logic commands
  - `rowCheck.js` - Validation logic
  - Dates submodule

- **GAS-dependent modules** (require SpreadsheetApp, PropertiesService, etc.):
  - `Schedule.js` - Spreadsheet interaction (tightly coupled to SpreadsheetApp)
  - `RideManager.js` - RWGPS and Calendar integration
  - `UIManager.js` - User interface dialogs
  - `MenuFunctions.js` - Menu handlers
  - `triggers.js` - GAS event handlers

- **Mixed modules** (candidates for refactoring):
  - `ProcessingManager.js` - Uses PropertiesService for state management
  - `UserLogger.js` - Uses DriveApp and Session

#### Areas for Separation Improvement
**Schedule & Row Classes** - Currently tightly coupled to SpreadsheetApp:
- These classes leak GAS dependencies throughout the codebase
- Spreadsheets are small (few hundred rows, ~20 columns), amenable to in-memory processing
- **Target architecture**: Load spreadsheet → Convert to domain objects → Pass to business layer → Merge updates → Save back
- Use Fiddler for I/O layer instead of direct SpreadsheetApp manipulation
- Keep pure JavaScript business logic separate from GAS persistence layer

#### Module Export/Import Pattern
Due to GAS limitations, the code uses a conditional module pattern:

```javascript
// At top of file for Node.js/Jest compatibility
if (typeof require !== 'undefined') {
    var SomeModule = require('./SomeModule');  // Use 'var', not 'const'!
}

// Module definition using IIFE or direct assignment
var ModuleName = (function() {
    class ModuleName {
        // Implementation
    }
    return ModuleName;
})();

// At bottom of file for Node.js/Jest export
if (typeof module !== 'undefined') {
    module.exports = ModuleName;  // Export the module, NOT 'var ModuleName = ModuleName'
}
```

**Critical Naming Convention**: The variable name MUST match the class/module name:
- ✅ `var Event = (function() { class Event { ... } return Event; })()`
- ✅ `var Row = (function() { class Row { ... } return Row; })()`
- ❌ `const Event = ...` (causes redeclaration errors)
- ❌ `var Event = Event;` (syntax error - already declared by the class)

**Why use `var` instead of `const`**:
- GAS concatenates all files into global scope in arbitrary order
- `var` declarations are hoisted and can be redeclared without error
- `const` and `let` cause "already declared" errors when files load out of order
- Inside `if (typeof require !== 'undefined')` blocks, we still use `var` for consistency

#### Centralized Exports Pattern
`Exports.js` provides a single point of access to all modules using lazy property getters:

```javascript
var Exports = {
    get ModuleName() {
        return ModuleName;  // Returns the global variable
    },
    // ... other modules
};
```

**Benefits**:
- Lazy evaluation: module is resolved when accessed, not when defined
- Handles GAS arbitrary file loading order automatically
- Single import point for all modules
- Access via `Exports.ModuleName` (property, not function call)

**Usage in code**:
```javascript
// ✅ Correct - property access
const command = Exports.Commands.someCommand;

// ❌ Wrong - function call (old pattern)
const commands = Exports.getCommands();
```

### Key Components

#### Schedule & Row Classes
`Schedule.js` provides the primary interface to the spreadsheet:
- Manages the "Consolidated Rides" sheet
- Provides `Row` objects that represent individual ride entries
- Handles formula storage/restoration
- Caches row data to minimize spreadsheet reads
- **Note**: Tightly coupled to SpreadsheetApp - refactoring target for better separation

#### Command Pattern
`Commands.js` contains frozen command objects executed by `MenuFunctions.js`:
- Each command receives `(rows, rwgps, force)` parameters
- Commands delegate to `RideManager.js` for actual operations
- `UIManager.processRows` handles validation and user confirmation

#### Validation System
`rowCheck.js` provides validation functions:
- Functions return error/warning messages or undefined
- Used by `UIManager.processRows` before command execution
- Distinguishes between errors (blocking) and warnings (user can override)

#### Processing Flow
1. User selects menu item in spreadsheet
2. `triggers.js` calls `MenuFunctions.js`
3. `MenuFunctions.js` gets selected rows from `Schedule.js`
4. `UIManager.processRows` validates rows using `rowCheck.js`
5. User confirms via dialog
6. `Commands.js` execute via `RideManager.js`
7. `Schedule.save()` writes changes back to spreadsheet

### Testing Strategy
- Jest tests for pure JavaScript modules (Event, EventFactory, Groups)
- GAS-specific code tested manually or via `testEvent.js` style functions
- Mock GAS APIs in Jest tests where needed

## Fiddler Library
This repository uses the [bmPreFiddler](https://github.com/brucemcpherson/bmPreFiddler) to manage [Fiddler](https://github.com/brucemcpherson/bmFiddler) GAS spreadsheet access.

To the largest extent possible, please use the bmPreFiddler library to access Fiddler spreadsheets instead of directly using the Fiddler library. Furthermore, only use SpreadsheetApp for access to functionality not covered by Fiddler or bmPreFiddler (such as finding which rows were selected).

Note that `fiddler.getData()` returns a 1D array of objects representing the rows in the spreadsheet, and `fiddler.setData()` accepts a similar array to write back to the spreadsheet. This allows you to work with in-memory representations of the spreadsheet data, which is more efficient and testable. Furthermore the object keys are based on the column headers, making the code more readable.

Fiddler also supports formulas, which are preserved when reading and writing data, and are important for the Route and Ride columns since those contain hyperlinks generated by formulas.

### ScheduleAdapter
`ScheduleAdapter.js` is the GAS-specific adapter layer for the "Consolidated Rides" spreadsheet:
- Uses bmPreFiddler/Fiddler for bulk data I/O
- Converts spreadsheet rows to plain JavaScript objects with column names as keys
- Enriches row objects with `_rowNum` (1-based spreadsheet row) and `_range` metadata
- Provides selection handling via SpreadsheetApp for user interactions
- Supports filtering operations (younger rows, selected rows, last row)
- **Target pattern**: Load → Work with plain objects → Save back (batch operation)

#### Formula Preservation Strategy
The Route and Ride columns contain HYPERLINK formulas that must be preserved across read/write cycles:

**Storage Mechanism**:
- Formulas are stored in PropertiesService as JSON arrays after each save
- Properties: `rideColumnFormulas` and `routeColumnFormulas`
- Each property contains a 2D array from `Range.getFormulas()` (e.g., `[[formula1], [formula2], ...]`)

**Loading Process** (`_ensureDataLoaded()`):
1. `fiddler.getData()` loads spreadsheet data → returns **displayed values** (not formulas)
2. `_overlayFormulas()` loads stored formulas from PropertiesService
3. Formulas are overlaid onto Route and Ride column values
4. Result: data objects contain formula strings (e.g., `=HYPERLINK("url", "text")`) as values

**Why this approach**:
- Formulas are treated as string values beginning with '='
- Allows single unified data structure (no separate formula tracking)
- `HyperlinkUtils.parseHyperlinkFormula()` extracts URL/text from formula strings
- When `Row.RouteURL` is accessed, it parses the formula string to get the actual URL

**Saving Process - Cell-Level Precision**:
1. Each Row tracks dirty fields in a `Set<string>` (_dirtyFields)
2. When a field is modified, the column name is added to the dirty set
3. On save(), **only dirty cells** are written to the spreadsheet
4. Formula cells (values starting with '=') use `setFormula()`, others use `setValue()`
5. `SpreadsheetApp.flush()` ensures writes are committed
6. `_storeFormulas()` reads and stores current formulas in PropertiesService
7. Cache cleared to force reload on next operation

**Why Cell-Level Writes Are Critical**:
- **Version History**: Writing entire rows makes change tracking meaningless
- **Precision**: Only modified cells appear in revision history
- **Collaboration**: Reduces conflicts when multiple users work on different columns
- By writing only dirty cells, version history shows exactly what changed and when

**Critical**: Always load formulas after reading data. Row objects expect formula strings in Route/Ride columns, not displayed values.

## RWGPS Library
This repository uses the [RWGPSLib(https://github.com/TobyHFerguson/RWGPSLib) to manage RideWithGPS API access.

## Google Calendar Integration
This repository uses the Google Calendar API to create and manage calendar events corresponding to scheduled rides.

## Code Generation Guidelines

### When suggesting refactorings:
- Identify whether code is GAS-dependent or could be pure JavaScript
- Suggest extracting GAS dependencies to make code testable in Jest
- Maintain the conditional import/export pattern for compatibility
- Consider using adapter pattern to isolate GAS APIs (especially for Schedule/Row)

### When adding new features:
- Prefer pure JavaScript for business logic
- Use GAS APIs only in boundary layers (Schedule, MenuFunctions, triggers)
- Add validation to rowCheck.js rather than inline in commands
- Follow the Command pattern for new menu operations
